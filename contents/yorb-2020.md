# YORB 2020

## TL;DR
This is a multi-user online version of the NYU ITP/IMA floor. It is accessible via your browser (mobile-supported) and mixed reality headsets. This prototype was deployed with [Hubs by Mozilla](https://hubs.mozilla.com/#/). You interact with others and add content to the virtual space. You can do even more if you create a Hubs account. See you there, and please send us your [feedback](https://discordapp.com/channels/686702701769392133/692460981464334427) so we can renovate with improvements.

## What is this? üè°
Welcome back to the floor! We missed you. We created this shared online space to hang out, share, collaborate, and work near each other in our open browser tabs. 

This floor is built out of a Mozilla Hubs Room. The IRL Floor has many rooms, so this might get confusing. We'll just call it [YORB](https://github.com/itpresidents/YORB/blob/master/contents/yorb-2020.md#what-is-yorb-) from now on.

This guide will show you some things to try there. This is a community experiment, and Mozilla Hubs is in active development. We welcome [contributions]() as we navigate the possibilities.


## What can I do? üó£
Many things. Here's an incomplete list.

### Select an Avatar

### Move Around 
* Use your mouse or WASDQE keys
* All other device controls [here](https://github.com/mozilla/hubs/wiki/Hubs-Controls)

### Chat via Text, Voice, and Video

### Add Content 
* Draw in 3D
* Drag and drop to import photos, GIFs, PDFs, videos, and 3D models in GLTF 
format from sites like [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/) or [Poly](https://poly.google.com/)
* Copy and paste URLs to impoto images, videos (YouTube only), and 3D models
* Add YouTube Live events
    * If you want to stream your own event, you'll need to set up a [live streaming encoder](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2907883?hl=en). A free and easy-to use option is [OBS](https://obsproject.com/), and the residents can teach you (Jesse, Ellen, and Chelsea).
    * Google shut down their YouTube service to broadcast group video calls but [StreamYard](https://streamyard.com/) is a free alternative for streaming into a YouTube Live event with multiple participants.
    * You can also route a Zoom call into OBS and then into a YouTube Live Stream. So many streams. 
    * Make your own stuff! **Coming Soon!**

### Notes
* Objects will disappear when you leave YORB unless you pin them.
* Content can only be removed by the user who added it or by YORB moderators (residents).

## What is the code of conduct? üåà
YORB is intended for members of the ITP/IMA community (students, faculty, staff, residents, and fellows) to play, explore possibilites of interacting in this online environment, help each other, learn from one another, stumble upon YORB lore, and start your own.

Following [NYU's Conduct Policies](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-community-standards/university-student-conduct-policies.html), we are committed to providing an inclusive, welcoming, and safe space for everyone. Harassment or discrimination in any form will not be tolerated, and this includes any offensive and exclusionary content added to YORB. YORB moderators (residents) will uphold this value by removing any such content and ask offenders to leave YORB. Moderators can also hide and temporarily mute and remove users. 

To report an interaction or content that violates this code, please use [Discord](). To privately report a YORB-related incident, please contact *** tba ***.

Be kind and respectful to one another and help make YORB an inviting and vibrant space for our community.

## How do I get there? üîë
A Hubs account is required to pin items in YORB so others can see your contributions when you leave. You can also save custom avatars in your account.

1. Navigate to [Discord]()
1. Click into YORB (created with Hubs by Mozilla bot)
1. Click Sign into Discord
1. Click Authorize


## YORB is full, now what? üò±
In order to support mobile users, the recommended capacity of a Hubs Room is 25 users. If YORB is full, you can still hear what's going on from the lobby and use the chat to interact with others. 

Possible workarounds include linking to other YORBs from within YORB (the ITP/IMA multiverse!), as well as developing our own server infrastructure to experiment with this and other features. 


## How can I customize my avatar? ü§ñ
Not a 3D developer? No worries, it's simple to customize a skin for a Hubs robot avatar. Here are the quickest options:

### Use an Image
1. Drag and drop an image file or URL into [Quilt](https://tryquilt.io/)
1. Click Export
1. [Discord]() > Enter YORB > Set Name & Avatar > Browse Avatars > Create Avatar > Click to upload Base Map > Select your exported file > Save

![demo](https://github.com/itpresidents/YORB/blob/master/images/avatar-quilt-demo.gif)

### Photoshop an Avatar Skin
1. Download this and open this [template](https://github.com/MozillaReality/hubs-avatar-pipelines/blob/master/Photoshop/AvatarBot_2D_Layout_Layers.psd) 
1. Use different images, paint directly on the layers, or create a new layer following the guides
1. Uncheck the layer AvatarBot_UVs from the Layers' panel and export an image file
1. [Discord]() > Enter Yorb > Set Name & Avatar > Browse Avatars > Create Avatar > Click to upload Base Map > Select your exported file > Save

For example, say you want to create an avatar skin with the face of Tom circa 1996 and in a tuxedo. Create a face texture by blending together different portrait views and paint on the formal wear (or apply a readymade black tie layer from Mozilla [here](https://github.com/MozillaReality/hubs-avatar-pipelines/tree/master/Exported%20Texture%20Sets).)

![demo](https://github.com/itpresidents/YORB/blob/master/images/avatar-robot-tom.jpg)

There are plenty more options! If you're versed in creating 3D assets, then we'd love to post your steps here for additional customization possibilities. Check out these [recommendations](https://github.com/MozillaReality/hubs-avatar-pipelines) from Mozilla. [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is free, open source 3D creation software for building custom models, and the latest version (2.8) exports the GLTF / GLB file that is compatible with Mozilla Hubs.

## What is YORB? üåè
We're still figuring it out. More resources to come, but here are some clues from the 1990s:

> The Yorb was a television show broadcast by the New York University‚Äôs (NYU) Open Telecommunications Program (ITP). It transmitted computer graphics of a cartoon-like 3D world, which could be interacted with and ‚Äònavigated‚Äô by viewers using their home telephone numerical keypads. [Source](https://fog.ccsf.edu/~dcox/EMU/ravingwithyorb.htm)

> Yorb -- An Electronic Neighborhood -- The place to spread your message[,] See your art, announcements, ads, scribbles, music, home movies, distribute billboards, documents, and ...?... on Manhattan Cable Channel 34 Thursday nights at 11pm ..be there!
